## Hey there, I'm Seth ðŸ‘‹

I am a provisional psychologist from Sydney, Australia, currently compeleting a PhD in Organisational Psychology at Macquarie University. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a research project investigating how reflection (i.e., debriefs) and communication under pressure (i.e., extrinsic emotion regulation) contribute to team effectiveness and resilience.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects which target teams in either competitive (e.g., Sports, Gaming) or high-stress (e.g., Emergency Responders) contexts, and which seek to apply interventions in applied settings, to contribute to building effective and resilient teams. 

ðŸ“« The best way to reach me at the moment is via my [LinkedIn]([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sethcoetzee/))
